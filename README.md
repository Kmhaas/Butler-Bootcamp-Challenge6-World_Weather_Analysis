# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Results
* The minimum temperature for the trip was set to 75 degrees.
* The maximum temperature for the trip was set to 90 degrees.
* Most of the areas with these temperatures where located around the equator as can be seen in the world figure below.

* I choose the vacation destination of Hawaii. There were four potential hotels in four potential cities in the temperature requirments within the vacation criteria.
* A travel route could not be created as shown.

## Summary
* Successfully we have created a map to show where in the world we could travel to within the desired temperature range.
* We could not successfully create a route map due to the nature of Hawaii being an island. The travel options are walking, biking, or driving, one can not drive from island to island in Hawaii.
* If the traveling paramaters were also to include boating or ferry services I imagine the travel route map would have included those.
* I recommend further indepth traveling options should be included for potential island hoping travelers.
